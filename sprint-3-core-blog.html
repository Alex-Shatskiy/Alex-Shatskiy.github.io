        <h1>What is EQ and IQ</h1>
         <div class='p1'>
             <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
             <p>Emotional intelligence is being able to understand feelings not only from yourself but also others. Knowing why we are feeling a certain way and knowing how to approach it. Another thing would be How actively you are able to act to address other people's emotions intentionally and effectively, understanding sometimes when others are reacting a certain way is it truly how they feel or is it more behind it. Such as if someone is defective, is that they don’t want to talk about what's happening or is it that they don’t know how to talk about it. They might just need that push from someone to help them express and release the bottled feeling.</p>

             <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
             <p>EQ is different in the sense that you have a higher understanding of emotions and feelings, instead of IQ where you have a better grasp of information or skill that don't involve emotions. At times someone with a higher EQ would be more preferred than some with a higher IQ, because their ability of working great within a team and being more productive by understanding when they are able to put more of themselves into work.</p>

             <h3>Why is it important</h3>
             <p>Both are very important. EQ being important for the ability to understand oneself and others around them, knowing when to talk to someone when they need to talk, being able to encourage others when they are down, knowing how to work effectively within a team(communicating, contributing, socialising, asking for help). IQ is important for knowing what you are doing. Someone with a high IQ is able to understand the workload and how to carry out a task, but without a high EQ they won't be able to work well in a team.</p>
