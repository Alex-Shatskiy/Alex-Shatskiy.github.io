        <h1>Sprint 5- Core Blog</h1>
        <div class='p1'>
            <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
            <p>
                1) First I've noticed that I was a bit more conservitive when writing blogs or posting in foundations, 
                but over time and the more that I did it started to feel alot more comfortable with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                2) I’ve noticed that I have started to enjoy writing blogs more and more. At first I didn’t understand the purpose of it, 
                however now the more I do it the more I started to understand the human side of programming, and the importance of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                3) Something that is kinda more interesting that I have noticed about doing the core exercises is that it is a nice way to unwind after 
                completing the tec part of the sprints, feel like I am able to relax and just reflect on the work I just had done, and give my brain a bit more of a rest 
            </p>

         <div class='p2'>
             <h3>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h3>
             <p>
                The biggest surprise with it is that I have started to enjoy and understand it. It’s not something that feels like a chore to do, 
                after doing it enough times I have gotten a better grasp on why we have the core, and because of that it gives me something to enjoy and 
                learning something new that I could apply not only to programing but to everyday life  from it that I otherwise wouldn't have.
             </p>
         </div>
         <div class='p3'>
            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <p>
                The most difficult part about it for me is to really think hard and try to explain concepts as simply as possible for people that wouldn’t understand 
                who haven't done programming before. Also another part that I find challenging is thinking hard about myself, answering questions directed at oneself 
            </p>

        <div class='p4'>
            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course and is it a waste of time?</h3>
            <p>
                Because working as a web developer isn’t just about the knowledge you have about how to code, it’s also important to be able to work in a team, be able to communicate with others. 
                Jobs don't only look for how good you work with code but also how well you fit into a team, not being able to work well with others or able to get along and work
                productively in a team will make it extremely hard to find a job, that's why we are taught core, so we are able to embrace our human side.
                Which is why it is not a waste of time learning either learning core is just as important as learning how to code . Good quote I can't remember where I heard it is :
                “An employer can teach someone to be a better programmer, but they can't teach someone not to be an asshole.”

            <h3>Preparing for Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>
                Starting off at Devacademy I'm hoping it will give me skills for not only programming but human skills that I can implement not only in creating a career within 
                Website Development, but also in everyday life. Though I don’t have much of a plan after Devacademy the one main goal I do have is getting my foot in the door 
                within the tech industry, and hopefully with that i’ll be able to build on the knowledge that I would have.   
            </p>
            <p>
                When thinking about what my strengths and limitations would be at the boot camp, I wonder what it would actually be. 
                Seems vague I know, but knowing what it would be kinda feels like it would be a stab in the dark. If I had to choose my biggest strength
                I feel like it would be the ability to learn and pick up concepts quickly, I’ve always been a faster learner and quick on my feet, so with that
                I feel like that would help me during boot camp. My limitations would be feeling overwhelmed , overthinking the problems and when at a deadline,
                might start to crack a little. Though it is a limitation there are always ways to work around them and learn to slow down when need be. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On the topic of limitations, the biggest non Technical challenge, I feel would be public speaking and presenting my projects to a class, 
                though i’m not good at public speaking, it won’t stop me from doing it. Hopefully during the boot camp I will be able to develop more of a public 
                speaking skill as well as more social skills that I could take into the workforce, aslo with the practise intervening at the end of the bootcamp 
                I hope that would help me be more  work ready, and comfortable with being interviewed, especially with large companies 
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally what are my expectations for when I start bootcamp?
                I expect myself to be able to prioritize my workload properly, 
                and not get overwhelmed by the workload. 
                Keep on track with my morning routine, as well as spending time outside of school hours when necessary to either keep on top of the workload, 
                and catch up for any work that I might fall back on.
