        <h1>Ethics & Morals</h1>
        <div class="p1">
            <p>This question on values,ethics and personal values has gotten me stumped looking at a blank screen for longer than I’d like to admit trying to think of what to write. The idea of writing about your core beliefs, describing what makes you you, feels kinda forign to me, I get some people love to write or talk about what makes them them, but for me it’s the opposite, I enjoy listening to what others have to say about themselves, the stories they have and listing what they believe in.</p>
            <p>A good place I found to start on writing this was taking a personality test, from the two I tried(viacharacter, openpsychometrics) both came back relatively similar, coming back with my core traits as Honesty, curiosity, forgiveness fairness and Privateness. Seeing these traits come out on top isn’t all to shooking and something that I can agree on.</p>
            <p>Honesty has always been a big and important moral for me, guess you could say that it was literally beating into me as a kid, it's one that I am incredibly thankful that its something I believe in. No matter what mistake I've made, always own up to it, deal with the consequences and learn from the mistake. Curiosity is also a trait that I hold close to me, though i’m growing up the idea of exploring different thing, doing something different or just trying different things has also interested me, and because of it, it’s gravitated me towards obscure or odd things such as fire spinning, moving cities on a while because I haven’t been there before, or even starting a new career because it looks exciting regardless of how difficult it would be.</p>
            <p>This bring me to another trait that which is stubbornness  not being able to give up on something regardless of how difficult it would be, which can be a good and bad trait to have on one hand lets me push myself and do things I otherwise would have thought I couldn’t do, but other times its bit me in the ass with not knowing when to quite or having things pass me by because I was to focused on something else.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately being able to come up with a scenario in which working  productively with others, but there was resistance or tension hasn’t really come up (in recent memory at least) I’ve been pretty lucky with having a good team with me when it comes to working together either on projects or co workers at work. Though I haven't has such scenario if I did take for example at work, since I was supervisor at my old job if my co worker had been refusing to work, i’d explaining why we need to get such work done, and explain that his laziness wont just get him in trouble but myself as well. I’d hope they would be understanding that it’s not just their neck on the line but mine too.</p>
