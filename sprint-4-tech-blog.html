            <h3>When the simplest problems are the trickiest</h3>
            <strong>What's the Problem?</strong>
            <p>
                The problem that was meant to be easy would have to be when we were doing the grade books challenges, 
                for the longest time a part of my code wasn't working because it didn’t recognise the name of a few student’s, 
                even though they were created in the code, so what happened?
            </p>
            <strong>How was it fixed | What techniques did I use to help?</strong>
            <p>
                The problem was that they were at the end of the code, this is a problem because the program reads from top to bottom so making it do a 
                certain action when it couldn’t find the people up to that point spits back an error, where it couldn’t recognise the students name. 
                Granted this was after many hours of coding running through this week's sprint my brain had been fried and turned to mush by this point, 
                and had pretty bad tunnel vision.
            </p>
            <p>
                After taking a bit of time away from the screen making food, coffee and relax, coming back to the problem and looking at it with a new set of eyes, 
                took time looking through the error messages, then looking through my code, taking time to talk through each step. 
                After slowing down it hit me like a ton of bricks…  After moving all the names to the top of the program everything started to work!! 
                All the names were recognized and the program started to make some head room in completing some of the challenges.
            </p>
            <strong>What did I learn?</strong>
            <p>
                What I learnt was that sometimes you have to take a breather away and know when you are at your limit, 
                we aren't machines and the longer we go without taking a breather and learning to slow down, and read though everything step by step. 
                Without this it  makes even the smallest problems difficult, frustrating or outright impossible to do at the time.

             <h3>What problem was solved with elegants?</h3>
             <strong>What is the problem??</strong>
             <p>
                This would be the last Scooby Doo challenge, we had to find what door Scooby was hiding behind and figure out a way for the program to search through it
                 and find him! On paper it seems pretty basic, but in practice not so much, many hours and few hairs pulled out it was solved, 
                 and in such a satisfying way too!

             </p>
             <strong>How was it fixed | What techniques did I use to help?</strong>
             <p>
                After giving up trying to do it myself, I turned to my partner who is a programmer and asked her for help, showing here and explaining the problem to her, 
                she had given me advice on just sitting and looking over the documentation on how to use the .find() function then come back and ask for help. 
                After reading the documentation on how it works, watching a video on how to put it into practice, I started to feel confident on how to use it to 
                find the sneaky scooby. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So what is so satisfying and elegant about it? Just imagine  after spending hours on a problem that you just can't solve after doing your research, 
                seeing the multiple tabs open on your browser, you're able to fix it within minutes!!! Instead of creating a large complicated thing, it was done in 
                2 lines and without problems, after seeing the red erros spit out turn to the glorious WHOO HOO your done has never felt so great. 
            </p>
            <strong>What was learnt?</strong>
            <p>
                Learnt that it is very important to reach out for help when it is needed, nothing wrong with swallowing your ego and being able to put your hand up for help, 
                it's a great way in learning something you otherwise wouldn’t be able to, aslo learning to google and read documentation is a must! 
                All the information is out there it’s learning how to access it and understand it.Though I didn’t mention it console log is an amazing helper, 
                being able to see what the program is doing gives you a lot of insight in what it is doing, and gives you a good idea on what to search for when you are stuck.
