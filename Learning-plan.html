            <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
            <p>I’ve always had this fantasy of being able to work while traveling and being able to change location from location seeing different sites while working my dream job seems like it’s the best combination. Knowing that I have a stable foundation not having to worry about income too would be where I know I could breath, that's where my goals would be. Maybe web development would be the stepping stones or something else.

            <h3>Skills I would like to see develop</h3>
            <p>The skills I would like to see develop over the period of studying with EDA would be, having a more motivated outlook knowing where there's work to do, especially something that I've been procrastinating on just to get it done. Over the past couple of weeks I have noticed that these skills are developing, even something that I have been putting off after starting. I can't help but keep going at it. Another skill I would like to see develop would be the idea on how to network and meet many different people from all sorts of backgrounds. Learning to put yourself out there was never something that came easy to me, but with the human skills I feel that it’s something that will come over time.</p>

        <div class='p3'>
            <h3>Strengths and weaknesses</h3>
            <p>My strengths would be knowing that I won't give up despite how hard something would seem, I would look at the problem and just try it! That is the same for tech as well as, the human side of this program. My weakness would be expressing and putting myself out there, learning how to take criticism and a good manner and learning to grow from it is difficult but something I would be willing to overcome.</p>

        <div class='p4'>
            <h3>Managing workload and studying productively</h3>
            <p>I would definitely try to learn from my experiences and remind myself when I feel like I am going to burn out, or feeling frustrated or stressed to take a break go outside or put the work down for a day, many times where I’ve been to stressed and keep going it just makes the whole experience and project alot worse. If I just took a break and relaxed, saving me banging my head against a wall, instead of making more problems I would be fixing them. Just trying to get out of the tunnel vision syndrome. Another plan is to organise the workload knowing what I have to do that day, have a plan and break it down in small chunks instead of doing it all at one go with a time on studying 6-8 hours a day with weekends to catch up on any extra work.</p>

        <div class='p5'>
            <h3>Seeking out for help</h3>
            <p>I will be asking questions to the facilitators or the slack group whenever I have a question that I cannot solve after trying. I will use my own search ability first before seeking help. If there is not any need to ask for help, I can also ask for constructive feedback on my work.</p>
