            <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>
                What is neuroplasticity? In a basic definition it is described as a malleable brain. So what does that even mean? 
                It’s a term to describe the way the brain changes, learns, adapts and recovers throughout your life. 
                Take for example when we learnt how to ride our bike over time with repetition we had started to learn how to ride without falling off, 
                or  how we study for a test over the week by rereading and quizzing ourselves on the questions for it to sink into our brains. 
                This is the basic way Neuroplasticity works, it creates brain neuron pathways  from our repetitive learning for us to understand/ have the ability to do.
                Hence why the term “practice makes perfect” holds up to be true.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem was that they were at the end of the code, this is a problem because the program reads from top to bottom so making it do a 
                certain action when it couldn’t find the people up to that point spits back an error, where it couldn’t recognise the students name. 
                Granted this was after many hours of coding running through this week's sprint my brain had been fried and turned to mush by this point, 
                and had pretty bad tunnel vision.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though the benefits of neuroplasticity where we can rewire our brain, it also works the opposite for bad habits and negative thinking. 
                The more we repeat bad habits or the more negative thinking we do trains our brains to follow that path instead. 
                Though neuroplasticity is neither good nor bad, it depends on the individual on how they want to train their brain, 
                and which pathways they want to strengthen.

             <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
             <p>
                A growth mindset is someone who believes that their skill and understanding are not fixed. They have the ability to understand that even though they 
                aren't great at something right now with enough practice, dedication and time they put into something they will become better, 
                because of our brain neuroplasticity.
             </p>

             <p>
                For a bit of contrast someone with a fixed mindset is the opposite. They are one to believe that you are born to be good at things. 
                Take for example someone who isn’t good at math would say i’m not a math person so I will never be good at it and give up. 
                That is someone with a fixed mindset, someone with a growth mindset would think that though they aren't good now with enough time, practice, 
                and patience they’ll start to become amazing at maths, which they will. 
            </p>

            <h3>How would this influence learning?</h3>
            <p>
                Now understanding what neuroplasticity is, what a growth mindset is and how both play a role in learning. 
                It’s time to set things in place such as habits, learning schedule and a more positive mindset towards each set of skills that you want 
                to dive deeper into.
